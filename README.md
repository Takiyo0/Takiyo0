### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Takiyo, it's not my real name but i love it when somebody called me Takiyo, i love animes so much. Beside that, i love coding too! I'm still a beginner at coding and i'll try my best so maybe i can be a pro programmer like you!
I'm still a student, so my code time might be divided by my school time :(
I'm currently learning javascript, html, css! Yeah, it's a basic library

I don't know why html is my top language lmao. Maybe because i have a lot of repos and it's my website!
